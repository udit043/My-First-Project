# My-First-Project

This was my very first project , build during summer vacations (18 June - 21 June) 2014 and final stable executable file released on 21 June 2014.

That time i don't know much coding , i just want to make a program , a big program.

I start with very simple permutation combinatios (list) of user's name and then music starts automatically and then wallpaper (Windows 7) starts changing with my pics(4) and then Internet Explorer/Google Chrome/Firefox opens and direct you to your email account(gmail,yahoo,rediff,other) and to my Facebook page , for you to contact me. I insert keylogger also to gain information of user but at that time i don't know about how to get that information(.txt) to my email.

Here is the executable file , works best with Windows 7
